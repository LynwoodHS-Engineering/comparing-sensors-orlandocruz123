1. What is the actual physical process that is allowing the Raspberry Pi to sense the environmnet?

The Raspberry Pi senses the environment through electrical signals from the sensors that are connected to its pins. Specifically through our active sensor, the ultrasonic sensor.

2. What are some environmental factors that might influence the performance of these sensors?

Poor wiring can affect these sensors. I had poor wiring on mine and it was not reading the distance on the ultrasonic sensor nor the press of the limit switch.

3. What role does coding play in this process?

Coding allows the Raspberry Pi to read the electrical signals it is receiving. Without the code, the Raspberry Pi would not know what to do with the electrical signals.
